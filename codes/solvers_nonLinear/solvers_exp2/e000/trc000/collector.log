Processing profile metrics and debug information
Error: Error 0x40000024 (No data) -- No data is collected. Possible reasons:
 - Workload is too small. No samples are collected.
 - The application environment is not specified correctly.
 - The executable file has been stripped so cannot be profiled with algorithm analysis types.
 See the Troubleshooting help topic for more details.
